# Problem
The combined changes across performance, backend pagination, and CI flow can regress behavior without explicit cross-cutting validation.

# Scope
- In:
- Add/adjust tests covering:
  - lazy-loaded modal flows,
  - leaderboard cursor pagination behavior,
  - tie marker correctness across page boundaries,
  - CI flaky stage script behavior (where testable).
- Run and pass full validation battery:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
  - `npm run coverage:ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`
- Out:
- No new feature scope outside request 043.

# Acceptance criteria
- Regression coverage exists for all modified critical paths.
- Full validation battery passes before task completion.
- Docs are aligned with delivered behavior.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_043_bundle_performance_leaderboard_scalability_and_ci_flaky_hardening.md`.
- Quality gate for items `item_133` through `item_137`.
