# Problem
Dungeon combat still relies on a mostly fixed attack rhythm, which limits the gameplay value of Agility and makes encounters feel too static.

# Scope
- In:
  - Introduce per-hero attack cooldown state in dungeon runtime.
  - Resolve attack cadence with Agility-based interval formula using clamp bounds.
  - Apply diminishing returns in Agility conversion to avoid runaway speed scaling.
  - Support multi-proc cooldown resolution for large deltas/offline catch-up.
  - Keep enemy cadence fixed in v1 for controlled balancing.
- Out:
  - Full enemy speed scaling by stats in v1.
  - Rework of damage formulas unrelated to cadence.

# Decisions (v1)
- Default `baseAttackMs` to `DUNGEON_SIMULATION_STEP_MS` when no archetype value exists.
- Use `attackIntervalMs = clamp(250, 1400, round(baseAttackMs / (1 + agility * 0.02)))`.
- Resolve interval on each cooldown reset using current effective Agility and snapshot `agilityAtRunStart` for replay metadata.
- Initialize `attackCooldownMs` to the resolved interval on run start/restart and on hydrate if missing.
- Enforce `max 3 attacks / hero / step` and stop additional attacks after the cap.
- Add a per-step event cap; after hitting it, drop `attack` and `damage` events but keep `death` and `run_end`.
- Preserve deterministic targeting (lowest HP + stable tie-break) and retarget only after hero phase.

# Recommended defaults (v1)
- Default `baseAttackMs` to `DUNGEON_SIMULATION_STEP_MS` if no archetype value exists.
- Use `attackIntervalMs = clamp(250, 1400, round(baseAttackMs / (1 + agility * 0.02)))`.
- Initialize `attackCooldownMs` to the resolved interval on run start/restart/hydrate.
- If the per-hero cap hits, stop further attacks for that hero and clamp cooldown to `0`.

# Open questions
- Is Agility dynamic during a run (buffs/debuffs) or snapshotted at run start?
- Should cooldown underflow carry over after the per-hero cap or be reset?

# Acceptance criteria
- Hero attacks are triggered by cooldown readiness, not one fixed global party strike cycle.
- Higher Agility results in shorter effective attack intervals within configured min/max bounds.
- Large `deltaMs` paths correctly resolve multiple attacks without infinite loops.
- Runtime remains deterministic for same seed and same initial state.

# Priority
- Impact: High (core combat feel + progression value).
- Urgency: High (foundation for combat system improvements in req_020).
