# Problem
Weighted RNG, discovery masking, and runtime reward rules can regress silently without targeted tests.

# Scope
- In:
- Add deterministic loot roll tests with fixed seeds.
- Add rule tests:
  - exactly one loot on victory,
  - no loot on failure,
  - rare exclusive slot restrictions (ring/amulet),
  - scaling checks by dungeon difficulty.
- Add UI tests for preparation loot table visibility and `??` masking/reveal.
- Run full validation battery.
- Out:
- No new gameplay feature scope.

# Acceptance criteria
- Critical dungeon loot rules are covered by automated tests.
- Preparation-tab loot table masking behavior is covered.
- Full validation battery passes:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
  - `npm run coverage:ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_044_dungeon_weighted_loot_tables_with_dungeon_exclusive_rare_items.md`.
- Quality gate for items `item_139` through `item_143`.
