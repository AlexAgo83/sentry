# Problem
Users cannot access repository change history from inside the app because there is no dedicated `Changelogs` entry in `Settings`.

# Scope
- In:
- Add a `Changelogs` action in Settings UI.
- Place `Changelogs` directly before `About` in the Settings button list.
- Wire action to open a dedicated changelogs modal route/state in the existing modal system.
- Keep alignment with existing settings action style and interaction patterns.
- Out:
- No data fetching in this item.
- No pagination logic in this item.

# Acceptance criteria
- `Settings` displays a `Changelogs` action.
- `Changelogs` is positioned immediately before `About`.
- Clicking `Changelogs` opens the expected modal shell.
- Existing settings actions continue to work unchanged.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_039_settings_changelogs_modal_with_paginated_github_commits.md`.
