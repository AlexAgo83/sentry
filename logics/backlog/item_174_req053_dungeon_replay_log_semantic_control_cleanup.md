# Problem
The dungeon replay log currently uses a non-native interactive element (`role="button"` on a text node) for seek actions. This is less robust than native controls and increases accessibility risk for keyboard and assistive technologies.

# Scope
- In:
- Replace non-native replay log interaction element with semantic button controls.
- Keep existing replay seek behavior unchanged (click + keyboard activation).
- Preserve current layout and visual style.
- Verify no behavior regressions in replay cursor updates.
- Out:
- Replay rendering/performance changes.
- Broader dungeon screen refactors.

# Acceptance criteria
- Replay log interactive entries are implemented with native semantic controls.
- Keyboard activation works consistently without custom role fallback.
- Replay seek behavior remains unchanged for end users.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium
- Urgency: Medium

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_053_accessibility_compliance_hardening_for_dialogs_tabs_and_keyboard_flows.md`.
- Likely touch point:
  - `src/app/components/dungeonScreen/components/DungeonReplayView.tsx`

# Delivery
- Replaced non-semantic replay log entries (`<p role="button">`) with native `<button type="button">` in:
  - `src/app/components/dungeonScreen/components/DungeonReplayView.tsx`
- Preserved replay seek behavior by keeping click-driven cursor jumps.
- Preserved visual behavior with dedicated replay log button styling in:
  - `src/app/styles/panels/dungeon.css`
- Added regression coverage to verify semantic button rendering and timeline seek in:
  - `tests/app/dungeonScreen.controls.test.tsx`
