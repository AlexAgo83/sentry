# Context
Records the full-project review findings and the agreed follow-ups.

# Findings summary
- Medium: runtime visibility handler is never removed on restart; can double-run offline catch-up.
- Medium: offline catch-up work is O(ticks) and may freeze the UI after long gaps.
- Medium: service worker cache strategy can serve stale assets after deploys.
- Low: `-webkit-appearence` typo prevents intended progress styling in WebKit.
- Low: legacy ESM import without `.js` extension can break in native ESM contexts.
- Low: missing tests for offline recap, reset flow, and UI actions.

# Decisions
- Remove the legacy JS implementation.
- Adopt a versioned service-worker cache strategy with cleanup.

# Actions (applied)
- Removed legacy JS folders/files under `src/`.
- Registered the service worker with a versioned URL and updated cache naming/cleanup in `public/sw.js`.
