# Problem
`backend/server.js` is a large change hotspot, making modifications risky and slowing iteration.

# Scope
- In:
- Split backend routes by domain without changing behavior:
  - auth
  - saves
  - profile
  - leaderboard
  - changelog
  - health/infra
- Ensure test coverage remains intact and route wiring remains identical.
- Out:
- No API contract changes; refactor only.

# Acceptance criteria
- Backend routes are modularized and easier to navigate.
- All backend tests pass; no behavior regressions.

# Implementation notes
- Route modules:
  - `backend/routes/auth.js`
  - `backend/routes/saves.js`
  - `backend/routes/profile.js`
  - `backend/routes/leaderboard.js`
  - `backend/routes/changelog.js`
  - `backend/routes/health.js`
- Wiring remains in:
  - `backend/server.js`

Delivered in commits: `1794ea2`.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium
- Urgency: Low

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_047_security_pwa_offline_ci_hardening_and_maintainability.md`.
- Should be executed after phase 1 correctness hardening and test additions.
