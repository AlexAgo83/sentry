# Problem
Local export currently emits uncompressed JSON envelope text, making manual copy/paste heavier than necessary.

# Scope
- In:
- Update local export path to always produce `schemaVersion: 3` envelope.
- Ensure exported text contains compressed payload and checksum.
- Preserve existing copy target behavior (clipboard first, prompt fallback).
- Keep save content semantics unchanged after round-trip.
- Out:
- No import parser behavior changes in this item.

# Acceptance criteria
- `Export save` generates v3 compressed+hashed text.
- Exported text can be copied/pasted as a single string in current UX flow.
- Export path does not regress existing local save modal interactions.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_042_local_save_import_export_compressed_and_hashed_payload.md`.
- Depends on `item_128`.
