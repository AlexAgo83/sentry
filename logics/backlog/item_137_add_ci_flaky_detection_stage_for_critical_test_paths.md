# Problem
Flaky tests can pass locally but break CI unpredictably, reducing confidence in pipeline signal.

# Scope
- In:
- Add a repeat/stability command for selected high-risk tests.
- Integrate a dedicated flaky detection step in CI before expensive downstream steps.
- Ensure failure output identifies the unstable test path clearly.
- Out:
- No rewrite of full test architecture.
- No increase in total CI time beyond acceptable bounds for targeted repeats.

# Acceptance criteria
- CI includes a flaky detection stage for critical tests.
- Stage fails when repeats detect nondeterministic behavior.
- Logs identify failing iteration and target test.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: Medium

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_043_bundle_performance_leaderboard_scalability_and_ci_flaky_hardening.md`.
- Suggested references: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json`, test scripts/helpers.
