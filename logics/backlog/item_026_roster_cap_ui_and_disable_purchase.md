# Context
Roster size upgrades become confusing once the cap is reached. The UI needs to communicate the cap clearly and stop purchases everywhere.

Source request: `logics/request/req_011_economy_action_inventory_cloud_qol.md`.

# Goal
Make the roster cap explicit and block upgrades when the cap is reached.

# Scope (v1)
- Define a roster cap (default: 20).
- Disable the roster upgrade action in the reducer when cap is reached.
- Shop tile shows “Maxed” state + short warning line.

# Acceptance
- Purchase action is ignored when rosterLimit >= cap.
- Shop shows a disabled button and a "Roster cap reached" message.
- Cap is visible in the roster upgrade tile (current / max).

# Notes
- Keep the cap value centralized in constants.
