# Problem
Without dedicated tests, changelog integration can regress on pagination, rate-limit mapping, and modal behavior under unstable network conditions.

# Scope
- In:
- Add frontend tests:
  - settings action opens modal,
  - list rendering from mocked payload,
  - pagination interactions,
  - loading/empty/error/retry states.
- Add backend tests:
  - success mapping of GitHub payload,
  - page/perPage propagation,
  - `hasNextPage` derivation,
  - rate-limit/upstream error mapping,
  - token/no-token request path coverage.
- Optional e2e smoke:
  - open Settings,
  - open `Changelogs`,
  - navigate at least one page.
- Run full validation gates.
- Out:
- No additional product scope beyond changelog feature validation.

# Acceptance criteria
- Added tests cover key frontend and backend feature paths.
- Full validation commands pass:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
- Optional e2e smoke is green if implemented.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_039_settings_changelogs_modal_with_paginated_github_commits.md`.
- Quality gate for items `item_114` through `item_117`.
