# Problem
Threat alone does not guarantee readable targeting. We need explicit taunt and stickiness rules, especially for bosses.

# Scope
- In:
- Taunt support with duration and threat bonus.
- Stickiness thresholds (normal vs boss).
- Boss always respects taunt.
- Target selection logic based on threat + stickiness.
- Out:
- No non-deterministic randomness.

# Decisions
- Taunt source: simple v1 flag or item (e.g., taunt horn).
- Taunt duration: `TAUNT_DURATION_MS = 2500`.
- Bosses always respect taunt.

# Acceptance criteria
- Taunt forces target selection for its duration.
- Bosses retain targets more often than normal enemies under the same threat spread.
- Targeting no longer always selects the first party member.
- Replay determinism holds for same seed/state.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium
- Urgency: Medium

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_023_dungeon_threat_based_targeting.md`.
