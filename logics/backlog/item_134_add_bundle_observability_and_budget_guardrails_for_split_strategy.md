# Problem
Bundle-size warnings are visible but not converted into actionable and stable guardrails tied to the new split strategy.

# Scope
- In:
- Update bundle analysis/check scripts to reflect expected post-split limits.
- Ensure bundle checks fail with clear diagnostics when thresholds are exceeded.
- Keep build artifact visibility (`bundle-report`) usable for follow-up optimization.
- Out:
- No changes to product UX.

# Acceptance criteria
- Bundle budget guardrails align with split goals.
- CI/local budget failure logs clearly identify offending chunks.
- `npm run bundle:check` remains deterministic.

# Priority
- Impact: Medium
- Urgency: Medium

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_043_bundle_performance_leaderboard_scalability_and_ci_flaky_hardening.md`.
