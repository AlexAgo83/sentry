# Problem
Loot gains must be visible and persisted consistently, including discovery tracking for hidden loot table entries.

# Scope
- In:
- Persist loot gains in inventory updates.
- Add discovery-state tracking per item (owned at least once).
- Emit clear action journal/event entries for dungeon loot rewards.
- Ensure save/load preserves discovery state.
- Out:
- No balancing of drop rates in this item.

# Acceptance criteria
- Loot reward updates inventory and is visible in recap/journal traces.
- First acquisition marks item as discovered.
- Discovery state persists across save/load.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_044_dungeon_weighted_loot_tables_with_dungeon_exclusive_rare_items.md`.
- Main references: `src/core/reducer.ts`, `src/core/state.ts`, journal-related UI/tests.
