# Problem
Users cannot access leaderboard data from the app because there is no `Leaderboard` action in `Settings` and no routed modal view for it.

# Scope
- In:
- Add a `Leaderboard` action in `Settings`.
- Place `Leaderboard` immediately after `Save options`.
- Wire the action to a dedicated leaderboard modal view in the existing system modal stack.
- Keep behavior consistent with existing back navigation (`Back` returns to previous view).
- Out:
- No leaderboard data fetching or ranking logic in this item.
- No username edition implementation in this item.

# Acceptance criteria
- `Settings` displays a `Leaderboard` action.
- `Leaderboard` is rendered right after `Save options`.
- Clicking `Leaderboard` opens the leaderboard modal shell.
- Closing/back navigation returns to the previous settings view without stacking issues.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

- Derived from `logics/request/req_040_settings_leaderboard_modal_and_cloud_username.md`.
