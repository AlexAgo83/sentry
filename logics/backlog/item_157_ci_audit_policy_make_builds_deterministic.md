# Problem
`npm audit` can fail CI due to newly published advisories, causing red builds unrelated to code changes.

# Scope
- In:
- Change CI behavior to be deterministic:
  - recommended: PR/push uses `npm audit --audit-level=high` (or remove as blocking gate)
  - scheduled workflow runs `--audit-level=moderate` in report-only mode
- Update `readme.md` (or contributing docs) to describe the chosen policy.
- Out:
- No dependency upgrades required unless needed to restore baseline stability.

# Acceptance criteria
- CI no longer fails due to moderate advisories appearing after the fact (without code changes).
- Policy is documented.

# Implementation notes
- PR/push CI blocks on `high`+ only:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Scheduled audit is report-only for `moderate`:
  - `.github/workflows/audit.yml`
- Policy documentation:
  - `readme.md`
