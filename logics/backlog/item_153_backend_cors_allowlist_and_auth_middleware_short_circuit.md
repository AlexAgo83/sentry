# Problem
Backend CORS is overly permissive in production and auth middleware may continue after sending 401, increasing risk and making behavior harder to reason about.

# Scope
- In:
- Implement production CORS allowlist:
  - introduce `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated origins)
  - in prod: reject any origin not in allowlist (while `credentials: true`)
  - in non-prod: allow localhost origins for developer convenience
- Ensure auth preHandler short-circuits:
  - after sending 401, it must return/throw and prevent handler execution
- Add backend tests for:
  - CORS allowlist behavior (at least unit-level logic tests)
  - unauthorized path does not proceed (no “double send”, no handler body execution)
- Out:
- No new auth features beyond correctness (same JWT model).

# Acceptance criteria
- Production CORS only accepts configured origins.
- Unauthorized requests do not proceed past auth middleware.
- Tests cover both behaviors.

# Implementation notes
- CORS allowlist (`CORS_ORIGINS`) + auth short-circuit:
  - `backend/server.js`
  - `.env.example`
- Tests:
  - `tests/backend/corsAuth.test.ts`

Delivered in commits: `14a419e`, `1794ea2`.
