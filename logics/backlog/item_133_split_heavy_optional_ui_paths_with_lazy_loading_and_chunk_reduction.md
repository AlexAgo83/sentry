# Problem
Large optional UI surfaces are bundled too eagerly, contributing to oversized chunks and slower initial load.

# Scope
- In:
- Identify heavy optional modules in system modal flows and other non-critical startup paths.
- Introduce `React.lazy` + `Suspense` boundaries for low-frequency views (leaderboard/changelogs/cloud/devtools-style panels as applicable).
- Keep primary gameplay path eager to avoid runtime stalls in core screen transitions.
- Provide explicit loading placeholder states for lazy-loaded views.
- Out:
- No functional redesign of modal UX.
- No gameplay logic changes.

# Acceptance criteria
- Heavy optional UI modules are lazy-loaded.
- Startup chunk footprint is reduced relative to baseline build.
- No regression in modal navigation/back stack behavior.

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_043_bundle_performance_leaderboard_scalability_and_ci_flaky_hardening.md`.
