# Problem
This request spans security, PWA, offline runtime, CI policy, and refactors. Without a cross-cutting test gate, regressions are likely.

# Scope
- In:
- Add/adjust tests covering:
  - cloud silent refresh + auto-login
  - warmup retry/backoff behavior
  - PWA update wiring (client-side) at minimum
  - offline catch-up step cap invariants
- Run and pass full validation battery:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
  - `npm run coverage:ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`
- Out:
- No new feature scope outside request 047.

# Acceptance criteria
- Regression coverage exists for the modified critical paths.
- Full validation battery passes before completion.

# Implementation notes
Regression coverage (high-level):
- Cloud auth refresh/warmup: existing app tests + backend tests (phase 1).
- Service worker update flow: `tests/pwa/serviceWorker.test.ts`, `tests/public/sw.test.ts`.
- Offline stepping invariants: `tests/core/runtime.test.ts`, `tests/offlineLoop.test.ts`.
- Backend route correctness: `tests/backend/*.test.ts`.

Full validation battery executed successfully (2026-02-15):
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run typecheck:tests`
- `npm run test:ci`
- `npm run coverage:ci`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e`
