# Context
Some panels re-render more often than needed due to non-memoized selectors and broad store subscriptions.

Source request: `logics/request/req_011_economy_action_inventory_cloud_qol.md`.

# Goal
Reduce unnecessary re-renders via memoized selectors and shallow comparisons.

# Scope (v1)
- Identify heavy panels (Roster, Inventory, Action, Shop) and their selectors.
- Introduce memoized selectors for derived data.
- Use shallow equality where appropriate in store hooks.

# Acceptance
- No change in behavior.
- Reduced render counts in dev profiler (qualitative).
