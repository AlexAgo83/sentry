# Problem
Renderer changes can silently regress (crashes in edge cases, lunge behavior leaking to ranged/magic, effects not cleaned up).

# Scope
- In:
- Add unit-level tests for effect selection logic (weaponType -> effect kind).
- Add tests ensuring lunge is only applied for melee (and not for ranged/magic).
- Add tests ensuring renderer does not throw when cues reference missing units.
- Run the full validation battery.
- Out:
- No visual snapshot testing.

# Acceptance criteria
- Tests cover lunge gating and cue stability.
- Full validation battery passes:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
  - `npm run coverage:ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`

# Priority
- Impact: High
- Urgency: High

# Notes
- Derived from `logics/request/req_046_dungeon_attack_vfx_arc_projectile_spell_beam.md`.
