# Problem
If the service worker activates immediately, a page can continue running with old in-memory code while fetching new chunks/assets later, leading to mixed-version runtime failures.

# Scope
- In:
- Adjust `public/sw.js` to avoid immediate takeover in production builds:
  - remove “always `skipWaiting()` on install” behavior (or gate it behind explicit user action)
  - keep safe cache-first behavior for static assets and navigation fallback
- Align frontend update UX with SW state machine:
  - show “update available” only when there is a `waiting` worker
  - activation must be triggered by user intent (preferred)
  - enforce prompt reload on controller change to avoid mixed assets
  - recommended: do not auto-reload during critical gameplay unless user confirms
- Add tests (where feasible):
  - unit tests for update wiring (event dispatch, activation call)
  - smoke test that calls activation path and asserts reload requested
- Out:
- No full Workbox migration.

# Acceptance criteria
- SW updates cannot produce a mixed-version runtime.
- “Update available” UX remains functional and results in controlled reload.
- Tests exist for the client-side wiring at minimum.

# Implementation notes
- Remove auto-`skipWaiting()` on install; keep explicit activation via message + controlled reload:
  - `public/sw.js`
  - `src/pwa/serviceWorker.ts`
  - `src/app/hooks/useServiceWorkerUpdatePrompt.ts`
- Tests:
  - `tests/pwa/serviceWorker.test.ts`
  - `tests/public/sw.test.ts`
