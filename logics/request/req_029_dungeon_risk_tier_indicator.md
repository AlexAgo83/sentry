# Needs
- Show a visible difficulty tier per dungeon to guide selection.
- Tier must be based on the player or party current power.

# Context
- Players need quick guidance on whether a dungeon is safe or risky.
- The tier should adjust as the player or party grows.

# Goals
- Compute a risk tier per dungeon from current power.
- Display the tier in the dungeon selection list and any relevant dungeon UI.
- Keep the label compact and readable.

# Locked decisions (v1)
- The UI shows a short label like `Risque: Moyen`.
- The tier is derived from current player or party power (not static).
- This is a guidance indicator only (no hard lock).

# Scope detail (draft)
- Data:
  - Compute an effective power score for the current player or selected party.
  - Compare it to dungeon difficulty or recommended power.
- UI:
  - Show the tier in the dungeon selection cell.
  - Optionally show it in the dungeon detail view or header.
- UX:
  - Keep tiers to a small set (ex: Low / Medium / High / Deadly).
  - Use consistent coloring with existing dungeon UI accents.
