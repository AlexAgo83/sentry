# Needs
- Address high-impact hardening gaps identified during the latest global review.
- Reduce authentication abuse and cloud sync fragility without changing player-facing flows.
- Keep implementation incremental and low-risk, with targeted regression tests.

# Context
- The project already has:
  - DB-backed auth rate limiting,
  - memory-only access token storage,
  - CSRF-based refresh flow,
  - broad automated validation (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test:ci`, `build`, `test:e2e`).
- During the review, four follow-up risks were identified:
  - trust boundary issue in auth rate-limit key derivation (client-controlled `x-forwarded-for`),
  - unguarded CSRF token writes to `localStorage`,
  - no lifecycle cleanup for refresh token rows,
  - one known low-severity transitive dependency advisory (`qs`).
- Constraints:
  - preserve current login/refresh UX,
  - avoid disruptive auth redesign,
  - keep compatibility with current backend and cloud flows.

# Goals
- Security
  - Prevent rate-limit bypass through spoofed forwarding headers.
  - Keep CSRF persistence resilient in constrained browser storage environments.
- Reliability / Ops
  - Cap refresh-token table growth with explicit cleanup policy and implementation.
  - Track and resolve the `qs` advisory with a deterministic dependency plan.
- Quality
  - Add tests that lock in each fix and avoid silent regressions.

# Non-goals
- Full auth protocol redesign (OAuth, MFA, password reset, session dashboard).
- Changing cloud save contracts or migration formats.
- Reworking all dependency policies in one pass.

# Scope detail (draft)
## A. Auth rate-limit trust boundary
- Update backend rate-limit keying to avoid trusting raw client headers by default.
- Support a safe proxy-aware mode only when explicitly configured.
- Add backend tests for:
  - forged `x-forwarded-for` cannot bypass limit in default mode,
  - configured trusted proxy mode still behaves as expected.

## B. CSRF storage write hardening
- Wrap CSRF `localStorage` writes/removals in safe guards (`try/catch`) consistent with read path.
- Ensure failures degrade gracefully (no runtime crash during login/refresh/logout).
- Add frontend tests for storage-denied scenarios.

## C. Refresh token lifecycle cleanup
- Define cleanup policy:
  - remove revoked/expired refresh tokens on a bounded schedule and/or during auth operations.
- Implement cleanup path with clear safety limits (batch delete).
- Add backend tests validating cleanup does not break refresh rotation.

## D. Dependency advisory follow-up
- Introduce explicit tracking/remediation item for `qs` advisory:
  - upgrade transitive chain when available or pin safe override if needed.
- Ensure CI visibility remains clear (no hidden vulnerability drift).

# Technical references likely impacted
- `backend/server.js`
- `backend/routes/auth.js`
- `src/app/api/cloudClient.ts`
- `tests/backend/cloudApi.test.ts`
- `tests/app/*` (cloud/auth focused suites)
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

# Acceptance criteria
- Auth rate limiting cannot be bypassed by client-crafted forwarding headers in default deployment mode.
- CSRF token storage operations cannot crash cloud auth flows when browser storage access fails.
- Refresh token persistence has a documented and implemented cleanup mechanism.
- `qs` advisory has a documented remediation decision and an execution path.
- New/updated tests cover all above behaviors.

# Test expectations
- Mandatory validation:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run typecheck:tests`
  - `npm run test:ci`
- Recommended:
  - `npm run coverage:ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run test:e2e`

# Backlog
- Backlog items to be generated from this request:
  - auth rate-limit trust-boundary hardening,
  - CSRF storage write resilience,
  - refresh-token cleanup policy and implementation,
  - dependency advisory (`qs`) remediation tracking.
