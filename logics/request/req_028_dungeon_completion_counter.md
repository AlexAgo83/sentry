## req_028_dungeon_completion_counter - Track and display dungeon completion count
> From version: 0.9.9
> Understanding: 100%
> Confidence: 87%
> Status: Done

# Needs
- Track how many times each dungeon has been completed.
- Display the completion count in the dungeon selection cell.
- Display the completion count as a badge in the dungeon render view.

# Context
- Players want visibility on dungeon completion history.
- The count should persist across sessions.

# Goals
- Persist a per-dungeon completion counter.
- Surface the counter in dungeon selection and in-run UI.
- Keep UI compact and readable.

# Locked decisions (v1)
- Counter increments on victory only.
- Count is per dungeon ID.
- No reset/season handling for now.
- Display count in selection list and in-render badge.
- Hide the badge when the count is 0.
- Badge format: `xN` with a compact pill (same style as dungeon pills).
- Show the badge in run and replay views.

# Scope detail (draft)
- Data:
  - Add a per-dungeon completion counter to persisted state.
  - Increment on `run_end` with victory status.
- UI:
  - Dungeon selection cell shows a compact `xN` badge on the right side.
  - Dungeon render view shows a small `xN` badge near the dungeon meta (and in replay).
