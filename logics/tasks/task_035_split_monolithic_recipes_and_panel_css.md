# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_040_split_recipes_and_panel_css.md`.
Split recipes by skill and CSS by panel, keeping a stable import facade and order.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Split `recipes.ts` into per-skill modules and re-export via a central index.
- [x] 2. Split large panel CSS into per-panel files with explicit import order.
- [x] 3. Update imports and verify no visual/regression drift.
- [x] 4. Add or update notes about CSS import order.
- [x] FINAL: Update Logics docs and notes.

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint
- npm run build

# Report
- Status: complete.
- Notes: Recipes split into per-skill modules with an index facade; stats/action CSS now imports panel-specific files in a fixed order.
