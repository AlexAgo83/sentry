# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_004_project_review_followups.md`.
This task executes `item_004_project_review_followups`.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Remove the legacy JS implementation (managers, panels, dataObjects, engine, legacy entry).
- [x] 2. Introduce a versioned service-worker cache strategy with cleanup.
- [x] FINAL: Record changes and keep the backlog item updated.

# Report
1. Removed legacy JS folders and entry files under `src/` to keep the TS/React rewrite as the only runtime.
2. Updated `public/sw.js` and `src/main.tsx` to register a versioned cache and clear old caches.
3. Captured the review follow-ups in `logics/backlog/item_004_project_review_followups.md`.

# Validation
