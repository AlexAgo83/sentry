# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_014_player_characteristics.md`.
This task executes `item_014_player_characteristics`.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Define stat enums/constants (caps, defaults) and modifier types in core data/types.
- [x] 2. Extend player state + save schema to store base stats and modifier arrays.
- [x] 3. Implement stat aggregation helper (flat + mult + clamp) with unit tests.
- [x] 4. Wire stat effects into runtime: stamina cost, action interval, skill + recipe XP gain, and loot luck (incl. offline recap).
- [x] 5. Update Stats panel UI to show effective stats + hover breakdown and temp buff timers.
- [x] 6. Add integration tests for at least one effect per stat.
- [x] 7. Run lint/tests and update backlog/task docs.
- [x] FINAL: Confirm acceptance criteria and progress for item 014.

# Report
