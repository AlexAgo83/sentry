# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_045_externalize_inline_svg_icon_payloads.md`.
Current state: SVGs are still inline in `src/app/ui/inventoryIcons.tsx` and `src/app/ui/skillIcons.tsx`. The chosen direction is SVGs per file (not a single sprite). Must keep offline/PWA behavior via precaching.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Audit icon usage and map IDs → file paths (inventory/skills).
- [x] 2. Export SVGs to per-file assets and add a runtime resolver that preserves the current API.
- [x] 3. Update UI icon rendering to use external files (fallback/alt + sizing parity).
- [x] 4. Ensure offline/PWA precache includes icon assets (no network dependency).
- [x] 5. Verify bundle report reduction and spot-check panels (inventory, skills, action selection).
- [x] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Validation
- npm run lint
- npm run test:ci
- npm run build
- npm run bundle:check

# Report
- Status: Done. Inventory + skill SVGs moved to per-file assets under `public/img/icons`, icon components now load external symbols, sprite removed, and SW precaches icon files for offline.
- Validation: Not run (suggest `npm run lint`, `npm run test:ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run bundle:check`).
