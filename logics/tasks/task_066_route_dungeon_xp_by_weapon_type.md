# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_080_route_dungeon_xp_by_weapon_type.md`

# Decisions
- Weapon type is the sole XP router.
- Missing weapon defaults to Melee.
- If weapon changes mid-run, XP routing updates immediately.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Update dungeon combat XP routing in `src/core/dungeon.ts` to select the weapon-type skill.
- [ ] 2. Ensure offline/replay determinism with the new routing.
- [ ] 3. Update tests for XP attribution.
- [ ] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint

# Report
- Routed dungeon combat XP to the weapon-type combat skill, with immediate updates on weapon changes.
- Updated offline/replay aggregation to track combat XP by skill deterministically.
