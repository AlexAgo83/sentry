# Context
The app does not have comprehensive test coverage. We need full app coverage, including UI, store, core runtime, adapters, and data definitions.

# Goal
Create and execute a test plan that covers the full application surface, with stable CI-friendly coverage runs.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Audit current coverage and map gaps (UI, store, runtime, adapters, entry points).
- [x] 2. Add UI test tooling (jsdom + React Testing Library) and basic render tests.
- [x] 3. Expand core/runtime tests for offline, visibility, and action flows.
- [x] 4. Add store and adapter tests (gameStore, localStorageAdapter, persistence paths).
- [x] 5. Migrate legacy JS tests to TypeScript where practical.
- [x] 6. Add explicit tests for `localStorageAdapter.ts`.
- [x] 7. Extend service worker tests in `sw.js` for the remaining branches.
- [x] 8. Add UI interaction tests for loadout, inventory, and offline recap.
- [x] 9. Set coverage thresholds and update documentation.
- [x] FINAL: Run coverage and verify thresholds pass.

# Acceptance
- Coverage runs cleanly with `npm run coverage`.
- UI, store, core runtime, adapters, and entry points have tests.
- Coverage thresholds are defined and passing.

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint
