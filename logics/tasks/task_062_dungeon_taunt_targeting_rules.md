# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_076_dungeon_taunt_targeting_rules.md`

# Decisions
- Taunt source: simple v1 flag on party member state.
- Taunt duration: `TAUNT_DURATION_MS = 2500`.
- Bosses always respect taunt.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Add taunt fields (bonus + duration) and integrate with threat model.
- [x] 2. Implement stickiness thresholds (normal vs boss) and boss taunt enforcement.
- [x] 3. Add/adjust tests for taunt selection and boss stickiness.
- [x] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint

# Report
- Added taunt fields, boss stickiness rules, and tests for taunt-targeted selection.
