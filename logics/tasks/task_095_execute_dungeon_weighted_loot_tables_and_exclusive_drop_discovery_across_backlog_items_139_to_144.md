This task orchestrates end-to-end delivery of dungeon-specific weighted loot with rare dungeon-exclusive ring/amulet rewards, single-loot-per-clear behavior, preparation-tab visibility, and discovery masking (`??`).

# Decisions (v1)
- Exactly one loot reward per successful dungeon clear.
- Rare dungeon-exclusive items are ring/amulet only.
- Loot power scales with dungeon difficulty.
- Loot table is visible in dungeon preparation view.
- Undiscovered entries are rendered as `??` until first ownership.
- Final delivery requires full test battery pass.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Baseline and guardrails:
  - Confirm current dungeon reward paths and inventory/journal integration points.
  - Define seed-based deterministic test strategy.
- [x] 2. Execute `item_139` (loot schema + validation):
  - Add typed loot table contracts and per-dungeon data coverage.
  - Add schema/guard validation tests.
- [x] 3. Execute `item_140` (exclusive items + metadata):
  - Add ring/amulet exclusive rare items and source metadata.
  - Ensure non-dungeon loops cannot grant exclusive items.
- [x] 4. Execute `item_141` (runtime integration):
  - Implement exactly one weighted reward on victory.
  - Enforce no loot on failed/aborted runs.
- [x] 5. Execute `item_142` (inventory + journal + discovery state):
  - Persist loot + discovery flags.
  - Emit journal/event messages for obtained loot.
- [x] 6. Execute `item_143` (balance tuning):
  - Tune weights and power progression by dungeon tier.
  - Validate rarity/economy constraints.
- [x] 7. Execute `item_144` (coverage + regression):
  - Add deterministic and UI masking tests.
  - Validate no regressions in dungeon/replay flows.
- [x] 8. Final mandatory full test battery:
  - Run complete validation suite.
  - Fix all failing checks before marking task complete.
- [x] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Validation
Final gate (mandatory at task end):
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run typecheck:tests`
- `npm run test:ci`
- `npm run coverage:ci`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e`

# Report
- Added typed dungeon loot table schema with validation helpers and per-dungeon table coverage.
- Added dungeon-exclusive rare ring/amulet item set with metadata (`rarityTier`, `acquisitionSource`).
- Integrated deterministic weighted loot roll at dungeon victory with exactly one non-gold reward per clear.
- Wired loot inventory persistence, discovery flags, and action journal loot event entries.
- Tuned loot pools to include shared and rare-exclusive entries with tier-based power progression.
- Added regression coverage for runtime rules, loot table integrity, exclusivity constraints, and setup masking UI.
- Full validation battery passed (`lint`, `typecheck`, `typecheck:tests`, `test:ci`, `coverage:ci`, `build`, `test:e2e`).
