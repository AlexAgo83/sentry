# Context
- Implements `logics/backlog/item_033_split_local_cloud_save_modals.md` and
  `logics/backlog/item_034_onboarding_hero_creation.md`.
- Split save management into Local/Cloud modals, keeping Setup focused on telemetry + navigation.
- Replace default hero auto-creation with a short onboarding flow that ends at action selection.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Confirm final UX/copy decisions for both items (labels, onboarding steps, starter action behavior).
- [x] 2. Implement Local Save + Cloud Save modals; move save UI out of Setup.
- [x] 3. Wire Setup navigation + ensure cloud/local actions preserve existing behavior.
- [x] 4. Implement onboarding flow replacing default hero creation; ensure action selection opens after creation.
- [x] 5. Update styles and shared components as needed; keep modal behavior consistent.
- [x] 6. Add/adjust tests (UI + selectors) and verify no regressions.
- [x] FINAL: Update related Logics docs

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint
- npm run typecheck

# Report
