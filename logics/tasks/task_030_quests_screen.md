# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_035_quests_screen.md`.
- Implements `logics/backlog/item_035_quests_screen.md`.
- Adds a Quests screen with shop-like layout and milestone quests for equipables + skills.
- Quests are shared across heroes (account-wide), not per-character.
- System should stay extensible for future quest types (lore, exploration, collections, etc.).

# Plan
- [x] 1. Data definitions: create quests list from equipable recipes + skills (static file, deterministic order).
- [x] 2. Progress logic: compute craft count + skill level completion, including progress text.
  - Ensure progress/completion is shared across heroes.
- [x] 3. Rewards: apply gold formula and surface it on each quest card.
- [x] 4. Screen UI: build Quests screen with Shop layout + quest cells (fade completed).
- [x] 5. Sorting: active quests first, completed last (keep all visible).
- [x] 6. Navigation:
  - Desktop: add header button after Shop.
  - Mobile: add Quests entry inside Travel menu.
- [x] 7. Tests (new + updates):
  - Quests list renders with correct counts and progress text.
  - Completion + fade state works when thresholds met.
  - Navigation entries appear in header + Travel menu.
- [x] FINAL: Update related Logics docs (request/backlog indicators if needed).
