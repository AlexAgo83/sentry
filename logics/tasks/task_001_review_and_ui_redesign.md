# Context
This task executes `item_001_project_review` and `item_002_ui_redesign`.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Map repository structure, entry points, and UI layout.
- [x] 2. Produce a project review with prioritized findings and risks.
- [x] 3. Identify test gaps and define coverage (unit + build + offline simulation).
- [x] 4. Implement tests and run the suite.
- [x] 5. Fix high-severity issues found in the review.
- [x] 6. Define a modern fantasy visual system (palette, typography, layout rules).
- [x] 7. Implement the new left-sidebar layout with responsive mobile stacking.
- [x] 8. Validate desktop/mobile UI and core gameplay flows.

# Report
1. Completed repo scan: entry points in `src/main.js` and `src/engine.js`, UI panels in `src/panels`, styles in `styles`, tests in `tests`.
2. Delivered review with prioritized findings (imports without .js, stamina progress negative values, default value rendering, hidden NBSP, and test gaps).
3. Defined test gaps: offline loop simulation, data persistence, action progression, and build validation.
4. Added tests and ran `npm run tests` successfully (Node 20.14 shows EBADENGINE warnings for Vite 7).
5. Applied fixes: ESM-safe Vite config, explicit `.js` imports, clamped stamina progress, fixed default label value handling, removed hidden NBSP, and normalized select options.
6. Applied the modern fantasy visual system (Cinzel + Source Sans 3, gold/teal palette, layered gradients).
7. Implemented the left sidebar layout and responsive stacking in `index.html` and `styles/*`.
8. Fixed action progress rendering to guard against invalid values; validation ongoing.

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint
