# Context
Derived from `logics/backlog/item_037_validate_cloud_save_payloads.md`.
Shallow validation: version + top-level fields. Unknown fields allowed. Invalid payloads should return 400.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Define minimal save schema + version contract (top-level fields only).
- [x] 2. Implement server-side validator and reject invalid payloads with 400.
- [x] 3. Add logging/telemetry for validation failures.
- [x] 4. Add backend tests for valid and invalid payloads.
- [x] FINAL: Update Logics docs and notes.

# Validation
- npm run tests
- npm run lint

# Report
- Status: complete.
- Notes: Added a minimal schema + validator with warning logs and backend coverage for invalid payloads.
